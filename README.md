# Binary Predicters Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for analysing the "Binary Predicters" dataset using Python and statistical methods and Machine Learning Algorithm. The dataset consists of various variables related to Marks, Gender and Admitted. In my prospective admitted is the dependent column to Marks and Gender, Marks are the independent columns. So in machine learning I used Logit algorithm for this data set. Our goal is to explore, analysing, Machine learning and draw insights from this data.
## Dataset Description
The "Binary Predicters" dataset contains information about Marks and Admitted. Each entry represents a unique dining experience and includes the following columns:

- **Marks**: Marks of the 12th grade .
- **Gender**: Specified Male or Female.
- **Admitted**: Admitted based on their marks.

## Repository Structure
- `BinaryPredicters`: Contains the raw data files used in the analysis.
- `BinaryPredicters.ipynb`: Colab notebooks containing the code for data exploration, preprocessing, analysis, Machine learning and visualization.
- `results/`: Output files, visualizations, and summaries generated during the analysis.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
